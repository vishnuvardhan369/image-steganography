Hello guys welcome you all
This is vishnuvardhan chowdary and this is related to my project called image steganography

Image Steganography : it is a process of hiding some data in images.

here I used python for image steganography.
I developed 5 methods(codes) for image steganography
1)hiding text in a Grayscale image
2)hiding text in an RGB image
3)hiding Grayscale image in an RGB image
4)hiding RGB image in an RGB image
5)hiding audio file in an RGB image

Mostly I used LSB steganography methods for image steganography
